# DECISIONS

Free-choice decisions made under plan.md §8, newest at the bottom. Each entry
records what was decided, why, and what was rejected.

## 2026-07-26 — Task 1: repo scaffold

### Bundler: esbuild, driven by a small `build.mjs` script

- **What:** esbuild via its JS API (`build.mjs`), not a framework or plugin
  chain. One entry point per extension context; static files (manifest) copied
  into `dist/`.
- **Why:** MV3 needs precise per-entry control — the service worker builds as
  ESM today, and the content script (task 4) must build as an IIFE. A ~40-line
  script gives that control with no magic, which suits the "audit the free tier
  yourself" positioning (plan.md §7). Bundling the `.wasm` binary in task 3 is
  a plain file copy here.
- **Rejected:** Vite + CRXJS plugin (manifest-transform magic; plugin
  maintenance has been uncertain); WXT (whole-framework abstraction and
  lock-in for what is a small, auditable codebase); webpack (config weight for
  no benefit at this size).

### Test runner: Vitest

- **What:** Vitest, config in `vitest.config.ts`, tests colocated with source
  as `src/**/*.test.ts`.
- **Why:** TypeScript/ESM-native with zero transform config; fast; its API is
  the de-facto standard. The pipeline tests in task 2 are plain unit tests, so
  nothing extension-specific is needed from the runner.
- **Rejected:** Jest (ESM + TS friction, slower); `node:test` (weaker DX,
  no watch/UI conveniences, would still need a TS loader).

### Directory layout

- **What:**
  - `src/manifest.json` — the MV3 manifest, copied to `dist/` at build time
  - `src/background/` — service worker (pipeline host, WASM validator in task 3)
  - `src/core/` — aggregator, verdict mapper, shared types (task 2)
  - `src/providers/` — signal providers; this directory is the §8-constraint-4
    isolation boundary
  - `src/content/` — content script (task 4)
  - `src/popup/` — popup UI (Phase 2)
  - `dist/` — build output, git-ignored; `chrome://extensions` loads this
- **Why:** one directory per extension context mirrors how MV3 actually splits
  execution; keeping providers in their own top-level directory makes the
  "zero changes outside the providers layer" rule visible in diffs.
- **Rejected:** flat `src/` (isolation boundary invisible); `public/` dir for
  the manifest (only one static file so far — a dedicated dir adds nothing).

### TypeScript config

- **What:** `strict` plus `noUncheckedIndexedAccess`, target/lib ES2022,
  `moduleResolution: "bundler"`, `noEmit` (esbuild compiles, `tsc` only
  typechecks), `@types/chrome` for extension APIs.
- **Why:** strictest practical settings from day one are cheap now and
  expensive to retrofit. `bundler` resolution matches how esbuild resolves.
- **Note:** `lib` includes `DOM` globally for now; if DOM types leaking into
  service-worker code becomes a real hazard, split per-context tsconfigs when
  the content script lands (task 4).

### Lint/format: Prettier now, ESLint deferred

- **What:** Prettier with default settings (`.prettierrc.json` is `{}`).
  No ESLint yet.
- **Why:** formatting consistency matters from the first diff; there is not
  yet enough code for lint rules to earn their config. Revisit ESLint
  (typescript-eslint, flat config) around task 4 when real DOM/messaging code
  exists.
- **Rejected:** Biome (would replace Prettier too, but its lint story for
  chrome-extension globals needed more setup than this stage justifies).

### Manifest posture: zero permissions at scaffold

- **What:** the manifest declares only the module service worker — no
  `permissions`, `host_permissions`, or `content_scripts`. A unit test
  (`src/manifest.test.ts`) enforces this.
- **Why:** plan.md §8 requires asking before any permission is added. Nothing
  in the scaffold needs one. Content-script registration and host access will
  be proposed explicitly in task 4.

### NOTICE names Daniel Alyoshin as copyright holder

- **What:** `NOTICE` (Apache 2.0 companion file) credits Daniel Alyoshin,
  notes the trademark carve-out for the TrueOrigin name (plan.md §7).
- **Why:** the repo needs a concrete copyright holder; the sole committer is
  the obvious one. Trivial to change if ownership moves to an org entity.

## 2026-07-26 — Task 2: signal pipeline (interface, aggregator, verdict mapper)

### `MediaInput` shape

- **What:** `{ bytes: Uint8Array; mimeType: string; sourceUrl?: string }`
  (plan.md §3 references the type but leaves it undefined).
- **Why:** the C2PA SDK needs raw bytes plus a MIME type; `sourceUrl` exists
  for local uses only (verdict caching in task 5, popup display) and is
  documented as never leaving the machine (§8 constraint 3).
- **Rejected:** `Blob` (byte-acquisition strategy is task 4/5 territory —
  `Uint8Array` is the lower-level common denominator and structured-clones
  cleanly through message passing); an `element` reference (providers must
  run in the service worker, which has no DOM).

### Core layout and conflict resolution by finding precedence

- **What:** `src/core/types.ts` (shared types), `aggregator.ts` (collect),
  `verdict.ts` (map), `pipeline.ts` (compose). Cross-provider conflicts are
  resolved in the mapper by finding precedence:
  `ai-declared > human-provenance > ai-indicated (above threshold) > unknown`.
- **Why:** the findings already encode the cryptographic/probabilistic split,
  so precedence is principled, not score-juggling: crypto outranks
  probabilistic (§2 "confidence is asymmetric"), and between the two crypto
  findings an AI declaration wins because a false "Human — verified" is the
  worst emission possible and §2 defines that verdict as requiring "no
  disqualifying edits". Losing signals are preserved in `Verdict.signals`
  so the popup can surface conflicts honestly.
- **Rejected:** numeric confidence-weighted scoring across findings (invites
  a probabilistic signal to outvote a cryptographic one — exactly what §2
  forbids); resolving conflicts inside the aggregator (kept it a pure
  collect-and-isolate layer so the taxonomy rules live in one file).

### `Verdict` carries basis, all signals, and failures

- **What:** `{ verdict, basis, signals, failures }` — the winning signals,
  every signal collected (including below-threshold and conflicting ones),
  and per-provider failures.
- **Why:** §3 requires "verdict + supporting detail for the popup"; the
  progressive-disclosure popup (§4) needs the full evidence, and honest UI
  should be able to say "provider X errored" rather than silently claiming
  it checked everything.

### Provider failures are isolated, and malformed results are rejected

- **What:** the aggregator runs providers via `Promise.allSettled`; a throw
  or a malformed `SignalResult` (finding outside the taxonomy, confidence
  not a finite number in [0, 1]) becomes a `ProviderFailure`, never a signal
  and never a crash. Failures contribute nothing to the verdict — an error
  maps toward Unknown, never toward any claim.
- **Why:** one broken provider must not sink the pipeline or corrupt the
  taxonomy (a buggy provider inventing a "not-ai" finding is caught here).
- **Rejected:** clamping bad confidence values into range (silently
  laundering garbage into evidence); per-provider timeouts (real concern for
  WASM, but it belongs with scan scheduling in Phase 2).

### `AI_LIKELY_MIN_CONFIDENCE = 0.7`, provisional

- **What:** a single named threshold in `src/core/verdict.ts`; probabilistic
  signals at or above it yield "ai-likely", below it they remain visible in
  `Verdict.signals` but produce no verdict.
- **Why:** §2 requires "above threshold" without fixing a value, and no real
  probabilistic provider exists until Phase 4 — any number is a placeholder,
  so it is one constant, documented as provisional, revisited when a real
  classifier's operating characteristics are known. 0.7 errs toward Unknown,
  matching the false-accusation failure mode §2 warns about.

### Provider registry: `src/providers/index.ts` exports `activeProviders`

- **What:** the list of providers the extension runs lives inside the
  providers directory; core never imports from `src/providers/` — the
  pipeline takes providers as an argument, and the service worker will wire
  the two together (task 3+). The mock provider (`src/providers/mock.ts`) is
  a test fixture and stays out of the registry.
- **Why:** makes "adding a provider changes nothing outside `src/providers/`"
  (§8 constraint 4) structurally true: the implementation and its
  registration are both providers-layer files. The §6 Phase 1 exit-criterion
  test (`src/core/pipeline.test.ts`) proves the pipeline weighs a
  never-before-seen provider with zero core changes.
